        <p>
          <b>Albert Einstein</b> .The special and general theories of relativity
          were created by German mathematician and physicist Albert Einstein. He
          received the Physics Nobel Prize in 1921 for his analysis of the
          photoelectric phenomenon. After being targeted by the German Nazi
          Party, he immigrated to the United States in the ensuing ten years.
          His work had a significant influence on the advancement of atomic
          energy as well. Einstein concentrated on unified field theory in his
          later years. At ageÂ 76, he passed away in April of 1955. Einstein is
          typically regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century
          due to his enthusiasm for investigation.
